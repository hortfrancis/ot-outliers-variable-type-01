Variable typography has been around for a while. It's not a new thing on the web, per se. 

This variable typeface, named Corsario, has two variable axes: 'weight' and 'optical size'. 

An algorithm was GENERATED and CSS transitions used to animate the variable properties over time.

Getting a smooth loop at was tricky; I added additional 'â€¢' characters at the start and the end of the text and then hide them with a screen reader only class. 

The animation applies to these characters, invisibly, giving the illusion of a smooth loop. 

The takeaway? In the new Now Future we inhabit, the Art of the Bodge is a highly employable meat-brain skill.
